localization:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 50

   * - Name
     - Technical name
     - Description
   * - :guilabel:`Uruguay - Accounting`
     - `l10n_uy`
     - The default :doc:`fiscal localization package <../fiscal_localizations>`, adds accounting
       characteristics for the Uruguayan localization, which represent the minimum configuration
       required for a company to operate in Uruguay according to the guidelines set by the |DGI|.
       The module's installation automatically loads: chart of accounts, taxes, documents types, and
       tax supported types.
   * - :guilabel:`Uruguay Accounting EDI`
     - `l10n_uy_edi`
     - Includes all the technical and functional requirements to generate and validate

       the technical documentation published by the |DGI|. The authorized documents are :ref:`listed
       above <uruguay/intro>`.

.. note::
   Odoo automatically installs the base module *Uruguay - Accounting* when a database is installed
   with `Uruguay` selected as the country. However, to enable electronic invoicing, the *Uruguay
   Accounting EDI* (`l10n_uy_edi`) module needs to be manually :ref:`installed <general/install>`.

Configure your company
----------------------

To configure your company information, go to the :menuselection:`Settings --> Companies: Update
Info` and configure the following:

- :guilabel:`Company Name`
- :guilabel:`Address`:

  - :guilabel:`Street`
  - :guilabel:`City`
  - :guilabel:`State`
  - :guilabel:`ZIP`
  - :guilabel:`Country`

- :guilabel:`Tax ID`: Enter the identification number for the selected taxpayer type.
- :guilabel:`DGI Main Branch Code`: This is part of the XML when creating an electronic document. If
  this field is not set, all electronic documents will be rejected.

  To find the *DGI Main Branch Code*, follow these steps:

  #. From your :ref:`Uruware account <l10n_uy/uruware-account>`, go to :menuselection:`Servicios en
     línea DGI --> Registro único tributario --> Consulta de datos`.
  #. Then, select :menuselection:`Consulta de Datos Registrales --> Consulta de Datos de Entidades`.
  #. Next, open the generated PDF to get the *DGI Main Branch Code* from the :guilabel:`Domicilio
     Fiscal Número de Local` section.

After configuring the company in the database settings, navigating to :menuselection:`Contacts` and
search for your company to verify the following:

- Company type is set to :guilabel:`Company`.

.. _l10n_uy/uruware-account:

Set up Uruware account
----------------------

To generate electronic documents in Odoo, a Uruware account is necessary.

To set up a Uruware account, first be sure to have a valid Odoo subscription. Then follow the
proceeding steps:

Locate the Uruware credentials settings by navigating to the :menuselection:`Accounting -->
Configurations --> Settings --> Localización Uruguaya`. Take a note of the admin email address that
is set, this will be the same email used in Uruware's portal. Click on :guilabel:`Create Uruware
Account`.

.. tip::
   Enter the email of the administrator or project leader. Avoid using the same email as the one
   used for communication with the |DGI|.

.. note::
   This action will create an account with Uruware with the following information:

   - Legal name (razón social)
   - RUT from the company
   - Administrator email
   - User name and last name
   - Odoo database link

   To ensure your account is created correctly, please add any missing information from above.

Once the account is created, a confirmation email is sent to the email used to create the account,
containing the account credentials to configure the account directly in the Uruware portal:

- Testing portal: https://odootest.ucfe.com.uy/Gestion/
- Production portal: https://prod6109.ucfe.com.uy/Gestion/

Use the account credentials in the email to log in to the portal.

.. important::
   Be sure to configure a testing account and a production account in the Uruware portal. The same
   Uruware account can be used for both environments.

Electronic invoice data
-----------------------

To configure the electronic invoice data, an environment and credentials need to be configured. To
do so, navigate to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configurations --> Uruguayan Localization`.

First, select the :guilabel:`UCFE Web Services` environment:

- :guilabel:`Production`: for production databases. In this mode, electronic documents are sent to
  |DGI| through Uruware for their validation.
- :guilabel:`Testing`: for test databases. In this mode, the direct connection flows can be tested,
  with the files sent to the |DGI| testing environment through Uruware.
- :guilabel:`Demo`: files are created and accepted automatically in demo mode but are **not** sent
  to the |DGI|. For this reason, rejection errors will not appear in this mode. Every internal
  validation can be tested in demo mode. Avoid selecting this option in a production database.

Then, enter the :guilabel:`Uruware Data`:

- :guilabel:`Uruware WS Password`
- :guilabel:`Commerce Code`
- :guilabel:`Terminal Code`

.. note::
   This data can be obtained from the Uruware portal, after configuring the :ref:`Uruware account
   <l10n_uy/uruware-account>`. The :guilabel:`Uruware WS Password` differs from the password you use
   to enter your Uruware account.

Configure master data

Review document types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some accounting transactions like *Customer Invoices* and *Vendor Bills* are classified by document
types. These are defined by the government fiscal authorities, in this case by the |DGI|.

Each document type can have a unique sequence per journal where it is assigned. The data is created
automatically when the localization module is installed, and the information required for the
document types is included by default.

To review the document types included in the localization, navigate to :menuselection:`Accounting
--> Configurations --> Document Types`.

.. note::
   In Uruguay, CAEs **must** be uploaded in Uruware. Sequences (and PDFs) are received in Odoo from
   Uruware, based on their CAEs. CAEs are **only** used in production. When testing, only a range of
   sequences used in Uruware need to be set.

Sales journals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To generate and confirm an electronic document that will be validated by |DGI|, the sales journal
needs to be configured with the following:

  system, for example directly in the |DGI|. Electronic invoices will not be sent to Uruware.
- :guilabel:`Use Documents?`: Activate this option if this journal will use documents from the list
  of document types in Odoo.
